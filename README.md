- Dynamic cubic environment mapping with reflection
- Back-face culling using a Geometry shader
- Phong shading
- Normal mapping
- Water [Moving UV:s]
- Mouse Picking [Pick objects from a distance with ray casting]
- Imported OBJ meshes with custom OBJ-loader
- Skeletal animations with skinned meshes imported with assimp. 
- Particle effects with billboarded particles [Particles emitted on the CPU, and rain drops in the demo]
- Billboarding [Particles and some selected objects are billboarded]
